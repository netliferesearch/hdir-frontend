## :clipboard: Rules

- All styles are written with SCSS (SASS)
- Follow the airbnb-sass-styleguide: https://github.com/airbnb/css
- Use the BEM methology: http://getbem.com/
  - An element can not contain an element. It always go Block -> Element -> Modifier. BEM shouldn't care about how the DOM/HTML is nested.
- Follow the WCAG 2.0 guidelines, with DIFI's modifications: https://uu.difi.no/krav-og-regelverk/wcag-20-standarden
